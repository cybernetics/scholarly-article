doco-ontology
=================

SA Document Components Ontology, in JSON-LD format.

### Article

Namespace `article`: `http://science.ai/schema/article#`

Basic article components and rhetorical elements class definitions, taking a subset from [DoCO, the Document Components Ontology](http://purl.org/spar/doco) and [DEO, the Discourse Elements Ontology](http://purl.org/spar/deo). Note that these two ontologies also incorporate the [SALT Rhetorical Ontology](http://salt.semanticauthoring.org/ontologies/sro.rdfs), which is no longer maintained. Therefore, we define our own classes where appropriate.

This ontology forms the basis for [doco-classifier](https://github.com/standard-analytics/doco-classifier).
